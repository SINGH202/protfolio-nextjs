  aboutContent: `Hello, I am a highly skilled and motivated full stack software
  developer with a strong background in web development. With a focus
  on building scalable and user-friendly applications, I have been
  working with a wide range of technologies, including Next.js,
  React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Express, and
  JavaScript. Over the past two years, I have gained valuable
  experience in developing robust and efficient web applications from
  start to finish. I have successfully collaborated with
  cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality projects that meet
  clients' requirements and expectations. My expertise lies in
  creating responsive front-end interfaces using React.js and Next.js,
  leveraging the power of Tailwind CSS for efficient styling, and
  ensuring optimal performance and maintainability with TypeScript. On
  the back-end, I have extensive experience working with MongoDB and
  Express, designing and implementing scalable APIs, handling data
  modeling, and integrating third-party services. I am well-versed in
  JavaScript, enabling me to build dynamic and interactive web
  applications. My strong problem-solving and analytical skills,
  coupled with my ability to learn new technologies quickly, have
  allowed me to adapt to changing project requirements and deliver
  solutions within deadlines. I am passionate about writing clean,
  well-documented code and following best practices to ensure the
  quality and maintainability of my work. I am now actively seeking a
  new position as a full stack web developer where I can contribute my
  skills and expertise to drive the success of innovative projects. I
  am excited about opportunities to work with cutting-edge
  technologies and collaborate with talented teams to deliver
  exceptional user experiences. If you are looking for a dedicated and
  experienced full stack developer who is proficient in Next.js,
  React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, MongoDB, Express, and

  team. Please feel free to reach out to me for any further
  information or to schedule an interview.`,
