# protfolio-nextjs
This Git repository is dedicated to the update of a portfolio website, transitioning it from an HTML-based implementation to Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered and statically exported applications. This update aims to enhance the portfolio's functionality, performance, and maintainability.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
